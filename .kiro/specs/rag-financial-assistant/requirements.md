# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RAG-Based Financial Analysis Assistant is an intelligent chat system built with React frontend and FastAPI backend that enables users to analyze public companies through SEC EDGAR filings. The system starts with an empty database and dynamically scrapes, processes, and indexes company documents based on user requests. Users can specify the time range (1, 3, or 5 years) for document retrieval, after which the system provides a chat interface for querying the processed company information using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.

## Glossary

- **RAG System**: The retrieval-augmented generation pipeline combining document search with language model synthesis
- **FastAPI Backend**: Python-based API server handling document scraping, processing, and chat functionality
- **React Frontend**: Web-based interface for company selection, time range configuration, and chat interactions
- **SEC EDGAR**: Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system for document scraping
- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Cloud-based vector database storing document embeddings for semantic search
- **Document Chunk**: Segmented portions of financial documents with embeddings stored in both local database and Pinecone
- **Time Range Selection**: User-configurable period (1, 3, or 5 years) for historical document retrieval

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to request company analysis by entering a ticker symbol and selecting a time range, so that the system can dynamically gather and process the relevant financial documents for that specific company and period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a company ticker symbol in the React Frontend, THE RAG System SHALL validate the ticker against available company data
2. WHEN a valid ticker is entered, THE React Frontend SHALL present time range options of 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years for document retrieval
3. IF the company ticker is not found, THEN THE RAG System SHALL provide suggestions for similar or valid ticker symbols
4. WHEN the user selects a time range, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL initiate the document scraping and processing workflow
5. WHILE document processing is in progress, THE React Frontend SHALL display progress indicators and status updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to scrape SEC EDGAR filings for my selected company and time range, so that I have access to all relevant financial documents for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company ticker and time range are selected, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL scrape SEC EDGAR for all filings within the specified period
2. WHEN scraping documents, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL retrieve annual reports (10-K), quarterly reports (10-Q), current reports (8-K), and proxy statements
3. WHEN documents are retrieved, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL process multiple formats including XBRL, HTML, PDF, and text
4. WHEN processing documents, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL extract and store the raw document content in the local database
5. IF a document cannot be retrieved or processed, THEN THE FastAPI Backend SHALL log the error and continue with available documents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to chunk and vectorize the scraped documents, so that I can perform semantic search and retrieval on the company's financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are stored in the local database, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL segment them into meaningful chunks based on document structure and content
2. WHEN documents are chunked, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL store each Document Chunk in the local database with metadata and relationships
3. WHEN chunks are created, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL generate embeddings for each chunk using appropriate language models
4. WHEN embeddings are generated, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL store the vectors in the Pinecone Vector Database with proper indexing
5. IF vectorization fails for any chunk, THEN THE FastAPI Backend SHALL log the error and continue processing remaining chunks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to a chat interface after document processing is complete, so that I can ask natural language questions about the company's financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing and vectorization are complete, THE React Frontend SHALL enable the chat interface for the processed company
2. WHEN a user submits a natural language query through the React Frontend, THE RAG System SHALL parse the intent and search relevant document chunks
3. WHEN relevant chunks are identified, THE Pinecone Vector Database SHALL retrieve the most pertinent information using semantic search
4. WHEN generating responses, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL synthesize information from multiple document sources using the RAG pipeline
5. WHILE processing queries, THE React Frontend SHALL display loading indicators and provide real-time response streaming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all chat responses to include proper citations and traceability to source documents, so that I can verify the accuracy and regulatory compliance of the information provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FastAPI Backend provides any financial information, THE RAG System SHALL include citations to the specific source document and chunk location
2. WHEN displaying responses, THE React Frontend SHALL show clickable citations with document names, filing dates, and section references
3. WHEN a user clicks on a citation, THE React Frontend SHALL display the relevant excerpt from the original document chunk
4. WHEN synthesizing information from multiple sources, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL provide references to all document chunks used
5. IF insufficient information is available for a query, THEN THE RAG System SHALL clearly state the limitations and suggest alternative questions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle multiple companies and maintain data persistence, so that users can analyze different companies without reprocessing previously scraped data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company has been previously processed, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL check existing data before initiating new scraping operations
2. WHEN storing company data, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL maintain separate document collections for each company and time range combination
3. WHEN users switch between companies, THE React Frontend SHALL load the appropriate chat context and document set
4. WHEN managing storage, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL efficiently organize data in both local database and Pinecone Vector Database
5. IF storage limits are reached, THEN THE FastAPI Backend SHALL implement data retention policies and notify administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive React interface that guides me through the entire workflow from company selection to chat interaction, so that I can easily navigate the document processing and analysis phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the React Frontend, THE RAG System SHALL present a clear company ticker input and time range selection interface
2. WHEN document processing is active, THE React Frontend SHALL display real-time progress updates and estimated completion times
3. WHEN the chat interface is available, THE React Frontend SHALL provide a smooth transition from processing to chat mode
4. WHEN displaying chat responses, THE React Frontend SHALL format financial data, tables, and citations appropriately
5. WHEN errors occur during any phase, THE React Frontend SHALL display clear, actionable error messages with recovery options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the system to securely handle SEC data scraping and maintain proper data governance, so that we comply with regulatory requirements and data usage policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping SEC EDGAR data, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL respect rate limits and terms of service for data access
2. WHEN storing financial documents, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
3. WHEN processing user queries, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL log all scraping and chat activities for audit purposes
4. WHEN managing Pinecone Vector Database connections, THE FastAPI Backend SHALL use secure authentication and encrypted communications
5. IF scraping operations fail or are blocked, THEN THE FastAPI Backend SHALL implement appropriate retry logic and error handling
